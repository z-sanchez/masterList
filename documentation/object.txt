This document carries the objects that make up the general calendar for the web application

Every year object holds a yearName, monthArray, and memory boolean variable
- yearName is used to identify the year
- monthArray is used to hold month objects
- memory is meant to signify if the year carries in user inputed date
this will be used to delete a year if it is useless

Each year is then stored in the yearArray, a list of all the created years in the application

createYear() function creates a new year object given its name, and calls 
fillMonthArray(), stores year in yearArray, and calls a sort on the array using
the funciton from searchSort.js

fillMonthArray() accesses a given years monthArray and fills it. First by giving the
first 12 indexes an array to store. This creates a 2D array. Afterwards, the funtion 
throws a while loop in which i = 0 and must continue until it is equal to 12 (++i at end of loop)
A series of if statements then identify whether the month has 31 or 30 days.
(using arrays contatining the months (identified as ex. Jan == 0) which have 30 or 31)
That new found index is then filled with a dayObject. The function ends with an adjustment
of the month february on leap years 

dayObject contains a date, month, year, numTask, taskArray, and onScreen bool.
it fills these in given a day, month, year. numTask = 0, taskArray is empty and bool is false by default.
