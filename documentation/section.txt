Section css file edits and styles the html section div

.dayDisplay is responsible for being hte container for that specific day's to do list 

.date is simply the style for the date on top of dayDisplay

section img edits the two buttons on both sides of the lists

.itemList is the flexbox for the list itself

.listItemBorder is the div that contains every list item. In the html it holds within 
the radio button and its label (the to do note). 

.radio and .item are used to style themselves within the listItemBorder

as of 7/12/21 the radio button still needs styling. I might use a different input type
since the styling of the radio button is browser responsible and not css
