currentDay is an object which holds the currenty displayed date

The application works by showing the currentDay in the center of the screen with the 
previous day and next day displayed in their respective position


setDayDisplay() takes a date with the month, day, and year described. It then dayDisplays
the date after running it through an algorithm to validate the date. First, fixMissingYear()
is called. This creates the year in the yearArray if it does not already exist and does nothing if it does.
foundYear is then intialized to the year object inside of the year array. dayLocator
is then set to -2. This is used in the for loop. The loop cycles three times to display
each day. Once for the previous date, current date, and next date. Adding the dayLocator
to the date will find the index of the correct day in monthArray. dateReference is used
to hold the current date object to be displayed. If statements are then defined to identify
if the dayLocator and date have accessed invalid dates. If a negative number date has been accessed
the algorithm checks if the current month is january, if it is a new year must be created and 
the dateReference is then set to the last day of december in the previous year. Else the 
locates the previous month and finds its number of days to set the new current date 
and sets that to the dateReference. Else if a an object located using the date is 
undeifned the object is in part of the monthArray which isn't meant to hold data, this means
a day in the next month and or year needs to be found and accessed. if month equals 
december fixMissingYear() on next year and set dateReference to the first day of the next year.
else acccess next month and first day of that month and set the dateReference to it.
Finally if an accurate date is found first try, set the date dateReference to it and update screen
and up dayLocator by one.



Now when functioning the two buttoms to cycle through dates on screen, I repeated myself in
validating whether a date was acceptable. In setDateDisplay() it changes invalid dates to correct
ones but doesn't update the currentDay object. In the buttons functioning is does both using promises.
I like the second code better but needs to be implemented in a way where I don't repeat myself.

Each button has an addEventListener which updates currentDay object by subtrating or adding 
to the currentDay.date depending on which button is triggered. A projectedDate variable
is then created. This variable is used to carry a date. First it carries the year of the
currentDay object, it's month array, and the current month. It is then passed into a promises
which validates the projectedDate ensuring it isn't empty space (undefined). Then the 
currentDay.date is used to acccess the projectedDate's objects. What is found is then passed
through the promise again. If anything falls apart, the catch statement does almost exaclty What
my previous setDateDisplay() function does. I WAS DRUNK! Catch checks if the updated date
is negative or positive. Then resets the dates similairy to the other function.

Might need to consilidate later.
